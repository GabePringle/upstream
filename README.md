## Common Issues and Solutions

### "Fatal: Repository not found" Error

This usually means the repository URL is incorrect or you don't have access.
- Check that you're using the correct URL
- Make sure you've created your own copy of the template repository

### "Permission denied" Error

This typically means you don't have write access to the repository.
- Make sure you're pushing to your own repository, not the original template
- Check that you've set up your GitHub authentication correctly

### Changes Not Showing Up

If your changes aren't appearing on GitHub:
- Make sure you've committed your changes (`git commit`)
- Make sure you've pushed your changes (`git push`)
- Check that you're on the correct branch
